# Sut mae'r tywydd heddiw?

SMTH? is a card flip memory game designed to assist the learning of Welsh phrases of the weather. The idea was inspired from my own learning of the language and completing similar interactive activities to aid learning.

SMTH requires users to remember the position and the translation of the respective weather picture and match them accordingly.

### Colours

![color palette]("assets/images/palette.png)

-I decided on a palette of colours to be used on the game board to make the game more pleasing and to add a connection between the pairs. - Sourced from Coolors.

- **#74a7ff** - Body background colour. It serves as a cloudless sky.
